IMPORTANT: 
\nIf you use a taskkiller, you must add AppAlarm to it\'s ignore list (or risk your alarms not going off). If AppAlarm is ever forced to close, make sure to re-open it to reschedule your alarms.\n
\nAndroid 2.2 (Froyo) removed the ability for AppAlarm to force other apps to stop. This means that if you use AppAlarm with Pandora or Slacker (or several other music apps) you HAVE TO REMEMBER TO EXIT THOSE APPS EVERY TIME YOU FINISH USING THEM. Otherwise AppAlarm will only be able to bring those apps to the foreground, but it will not be able to make the music start. Sorry but this is a limitation in Android and there is no fix in sight :( \n\nAndroid 2.1 and below should still work just fine.\n
\nYou can now backup your alarms to your SD card. Just press the MENU button on your phone from the main alarm list.\n
\nAppAlarm Pro is now Free and Open Source! Code is available at https://github.com/ghackett/AppAlarm \n
